The 'Star Pendulum' visualizes time as a chaotic but orderly system. By linking the clock hands into a kinetic chain, the movement of seconds creates complex, organic curves. I used high-contrast colors and a 'motion trail' effect to emphasize the flow of time, while using a corrected-angle algorithm to ensure the user can still accurately read the clock at a glance. Finally, the blinking effect every other second signifies the "star" part of the code.
